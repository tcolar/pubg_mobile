## Basic settings

- Aim assist, can help tracking target
- Bolt action release mode : Shoot on press or on release
- Sniper firing mode: Shoot on press or on release
- Peek and fire: You **should enable that**, add buttons that allow you to peek sideways
- Peek and open scope: Off gives you more options, but you will need 5+ fingers, see Bushka video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azWqlNlYAI8>
- Lean and scope mode : "mixed" is usually a good choice
- Display left fire button, useful if you want a separate sniper button
- Gyroscope : A good option if you hold your phone/tablet and can't use too many fingers, like having an extra finger for aiming
- Separate jump/climb: Optional, but separate can allow you tricks to get on top of buildings and such
- Universal mark: On, makes it easy to mark things for your teammates
- Death replay : On, let you see how you died (and if it was a hacker)

## Graphics

It's much more important to get good frame rate than cute graphics.
I use smooth / Extreme, my device can do better graphics, but this keeps it cool without any stutters.

- Style: **Colorful** is probably the best option, the extra contrast makes it easier to see people. But it depends of your screen

- Brightness: **Tip:** keeping this low makes it easier to see in the fog !

- Auto adjust graphics, might be useful if your device has a hard time keeping up, but I rather have it off so the frame rate does not fluctuate

## Vehicle

Does not really matter, just make sre the car control don't overlap with other buttons

## Sensitivity

**This is hugely important**, if you can't control recoil, this is probably why, find what works for you in training mode.

Here is a detailed video from Bushka : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43nsOZPo6X4>

## Pick up

This is worth spending a bit on time on, picking more grenades and smokes might be a good idea, maybe you don't want to auto pick pistols, etc ....

## Scope

Juts pick whatever color and shape works best for you, I use a red dot

## Audio

Audio is extremely important in Pubg, it allows you to pinpoint where people are exactly.

Use the Ultra sounds and good stereo headphones
