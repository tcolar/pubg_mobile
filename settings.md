## Basic settings

- Aim assist, can help tracking target
- Bolt action release mode : Shoot on press or on release
- Sniper firing mode: Shoot on press or on release
- Peek and fire: You **should enable that**, add buttons that allow you to peek sideways
- Peek and open scope: Off gives you more options, but you will need 5+ fingers, see Bushka video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azWqlNlYAI8
- Lean and scope mode : "mixed" is usually a good choice
- Display left fire button, useful if you want a separate sniper button
- Gyroscope : A good option if you hold your phone/tablet and can't use too many fingers, like having an extra finger for aiming
- Separate jump/climb: Optional, but separate can allow you trucks to get on top of buildings and such
- Universal mark: On, makes it easy to mark things for your teammates
- Death replay : On, let you see how you died (and if it was a hacker)

## Graphics

It's much more important to get good frame rate than cute graphics.
I use smooth / Extreme, my device can fo better graphics, but this keeps it cool without any stutters.

- Style: **Colorfull** is probably the best option, the extra contrast makes it easier to see people. But it depends of your screen]

- Brightness: **tip** keeping this low makes it easier to see in the fog !

- Auto adjust graphics, might be useful if your device has a hard time keeping up, but I rather have it off so the frame rate does not fluctuate

## Vehicle

Does not really matter, ust make sre the car control don't overlap other buttons

## Sensitivity

**This is hugely important**, if you can't control recoil,m this might be why, find what's best in training mode.

Here is a detailed video from Bushka : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43nsOZPo6X4

## Pick up

This is worth spending a bit on time on, picking more grenades and smokes might be a good idea, maybe you don't want to auto pick pistols, etc ....

## Scope

Juts ick whatever color and shape works best for you, I use the red dot

## Audio

Audio is very important in Pubg, it allows you to pinpoint where people are exactly.

Use the Ultra sounds and good stereo headphones
