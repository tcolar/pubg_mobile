## Intro

Hi, these few pages are meant to contain all the info you need to know about Pubg Mobile, for quick reference.

Note: I've been playing Pubg mobile since season 3 and I'm a decent player, but nothing special and very very far from a pro player, however there is a lot I have learned and want tio share.

A lot of the info here is a mix of things I learned on my own, and a lot of info I've collected from watching others play.

## Fav Streamers

Many of the things I've learned is from watching streamers, here is short list of my favs:

- **Bushka**
  By far my favorite, he spends more time teaching than playing and is excellent at both, he also uses a very scientific approach and use facts and delivers a ton of content, he is the Alton Brown of Pubg :)
