A collection of various tips I learned over time.

#### Switch weapons

Make sure your weapon buttons are easy to access, so you can quickly switch between them, instead of waiting several seconds for your primary weapon to reload, switch to your other one instead, even possibly to your side weapon if needs be.

#### Leverage weapons firing mode

Many weapons have several firing mode: auto, single, sometimes burst too.
They can be very useful when you don't have the "ideal" weapon.

A M416 on single shot is a decent poor man's DMR for example, even an AKM can be reasonably used at range in single shot.

On the other hand be careful not to accidentally put, or leave, a weapon on single shot, let me tell you about the time I put my Uzi on single shot ;)

#### Run faster without weapons

Somehow I played for a full season without knowing that, dying while running in the blue.
Deselect any weapons and you can run quite a bit faster, this can also help when running from a spray in the open.

#### Use your Uzi when riding a bike

A few weapons can be used as the passenger riding a motorcycle, for example the Uzi.

#### Fog trick

Fog can be pretty annoying, switch the brightness to zero in your in game settings reduces it's effect quite a bit.

#### Switch to FPP view in heavy smoke or fog

Because the FPP camera is lower and forward (compared to the TPP one that is behind your back), the FPP view lest you see a bit further ahead.

#### Chat history

Ever had a teammate mark a item for you, but by the time you get there the marker is gone ?
Click the chat icon, then in the chat popup, click the "clock" (history) icon. Click the item you missed and the marker will show again !

#### Use throwables

Seriously, these can give you a huge strategic advantage, see the weapons page for more details.

#### Pre-fire

Pe-firing, is starting to fire before seeing the enemy, for example when entering a door or rounding a corner where you know an opponent is there, It's best done with a weapon with a larger mag, but the idea is that you will put some damage on the enemy before he reacts and starts shooting back at you, giving you an advantage.
